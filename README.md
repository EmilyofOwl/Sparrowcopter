A light (sub 250g take off weight) quadcopter drone, that should form a flexible basis for future experimentations with UAVs.

## Caveats to information provided.

Unfortunately, due to UK Strategic Export Controls, I will be unable to upload any CAD models or similar. This is as they specifically prohibit export of "technology" (which includes models, blueprints, and drawings) related to "airframe structures and components" to Iran. Due to the nature of upload to github meaning that anyone with internet access (including individuals in Iran) can find such files I am worried that the upload of CAD models could constitute a violation of export controls. If you aren't in Iran and would like the CAD models (which I will release under GPL v3 as I do for the rest of the project) send me an email (emilyofowl@proton.me) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

I will try and figure out a way to share CAD models more publicly, and will update this once I know.
