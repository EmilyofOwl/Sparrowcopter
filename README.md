## Caveats to information provided.

UK Strategic Export Controls prohibit the export of "technology" regarding UAV's to Iran. However, as all information or "technology" that would contravenne this is published under GPL v3 (see the license) it falls into public domain under the relevant legislation,[^1] and so CAD models and the like will be uploaded.
